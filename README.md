# Sentiment-Analysis-Accuracy-for-2024-Indonesian-Election-Tweets-Using-CNN-LSTM

The 2024 Indonesian Presidential Election is ideal for analyzing public sentiment on Twitter. Data
collection began with crawling from the data source to create a dataset, which included 62,955 entries
from Twitter, 126,673 entries from IndoNews, and a combined Tweet+IndoNews dataset totaling 189,628
entries. This study aims to explore sentiment using a hybrid model integrating Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) methods, with feature expansion via Word2Vec

optimized by a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The research evaluates the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-
LSTM model in analyzing sentiment from 2024 Indonesian Presidential Election tweets, aiming for higher

accuracy and deeper insights compared to traditional methods. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model, optimized
with a Genetic Algorithm, significantly enhances accuracy, achieving the highest accuracy of 84.78% for
the news data, marking a 3.59% increase. This study illustrates the innovative application of a hybrid
CNN-LSTM model with Word2Vec feature expansion and Genetic Algorithm optimization for sentiment
analysis in a national election context, demonstrating how advanced techniques can improve accuracy and
efficiency in sentiment analysis.
